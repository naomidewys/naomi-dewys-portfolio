<h1>README - Portfolio</h1>
<h3>Intro</h3>
This is a single page portfolio with a minimalistic, streamlined design. I don't have any specific requirements for this project other than wanting a simple, easy-to-maintain design 
so that I could practice creating the different elements I've learned in previous workshops (e.g., making a navigation bar from scratch rather than using a pre-constructed design).
This single-page portfolio contains the following sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    HTML/CSS
  </li>
  <li>
    Flexbox
  </li>
  <li>
    Bootstrap
  </li>
  <li>
    Netlify
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
When the user first loads the page, they will see the main header section that features a greeting ("Hello, I'm Naomi") and has a gradient background starting 
with purple at the top and fading into white at the bottom. There is also a black navigation bar with the following links: Home, About, Projects, Contact. Each of these links will redirect
the page's view to the section selected (e.g., clicking "About" will show the About section). Under the greeting, there is a subtitle that states "Web Developer" and a fine-line artwork of a woman.
</p>
<p>
Beneath the header section, the About section will give a very brief overview of my pronouns (She/Her), my location (Australia), and where my interest in coding lies. Next is the Tech Stack
  section, which shows images of the different technologies I'm learning through self-paced, online training (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS, Python).
</p>
<p>
  The Projects section follows this, displaying several projects that I've recently completed. As my skills grow so will my portfolio, and this section will expand as I create more projects.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I have a simple contact section at the end that features links to different contact methods, including email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>
Since I knew I wanted a very minimalist design, I started by outlining what sections were needed and researching simple color schemes. I then started by adding in the very basic
  information required, including the header greeting, a brief bio, and contact info, and leaving space for adding previews of my previous projects.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to leave the navigation bar until later because I wanted to challenge myself to create a simple nav-bar without using a pre-designed one. I also wanted to leave the Projects section
  so that I could take some time to play around with grids and flexbox and decide how I wanted to set out my project images. As I'm still new to this, I wanted to keep it simple and clean
  and make it easy for users to find more information on the projects directly through the links.
</p>
<p>
  The footer and responsive design are elements I wanted to keep for last. Since I have the main elements on the page already, I wanted to keep the footer light, tying together and emphasizing the overall design
  rather than bigger a larger focal point. The responsive design was also kept for last so I could make any final tweaks to the design.
</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>
  I took the opportunity to practice several elements that still feel very new to me. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I decided to create a simple nav bar from scratch rather than use one from Bootstrap.</li>
    <li>I created a gradient background for only the header section with the rest of the body a different color.</li>
    <li>I played around with grids vs. flexbox.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>This project is still a WIP, but some of the things I'm still working on include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Responsive design for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
  <li>Confirming that accessible design practices are consistently applied throughout.</li>
  <li>Perhaps some minor changes to the footer. (I'm still brainstorming this.)</li>
</ul>
